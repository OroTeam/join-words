# join-words

`join-words` is a lightweight and easy-to-use JavaScript utility for formatting an array of words into a human-readable string. It handles edge cases like empty arrays, single words, and proper punctuation for lists of two or more words.

---

## Features

- **Empty Array Handling**: Returns an empty string for an empty array.
- **Single Word Support**: Returns the word itself when the array contains only one word.
- **Two Words**: Joins two words with "and".
- **Three or More Words**: Joins all but the last word with commas, and appends "and" before the last word.
- **Lightweight**: No dependencies, simple and efficient.

## Installation

Install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install join-words
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add join-words
```

---

## Usage

### Importing the Library

You can import the library into your project using CommonJS:

```javascript
const joinWords = require('join-words');
```

### Examples

```javascript
const joinWords = require('join-words');

console.log(joinWords([])); // ""
console.log(joinWords(["apple"])); // "apple"
console.log(joinWords(["apple", "banana"])); // "apple and banana"
console.log(joinWords(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])); // "apple, banana, and cherry"
console.log(joinWords(["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"])); // "apple, banana, cherry, and date"
```

### Edge Cases

- **Empty Array**: An empty array will return an empty string.

```javascript
joinWords([]); // ""
```

- **Single Word**: An array with one word will return the word itself.

```javascript
joinWords(["apple"]); // "apple"
```

- **Two Words**: Two words are joined with "and".

```javascript
joinWords(["apple", "banana"]); // "apple and banana"
```

- **Three or More Words**: Words are joined with commas, and "and" is appended before the last word.

```javascript
joinWords(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]); // "apple, banana, and cherry"
joinWords(["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]); // "apple, banana, cherry, and date"
```
